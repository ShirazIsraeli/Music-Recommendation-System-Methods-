# Background: 
A recommendation system is a tool that uses data to understand user preferences and behaviours, suggesting songs and artists that match individual tastes. 
Our project is ‘music recommendation system’ It enhances music discovery, saving users time and effort while introducing them to new music they're likely to enjoy. During the project, we explored recommendation systems approaches in general and in music specifically, looking for a dataset to work with. Our goal was to build a system that suggests the top 10 songs to a user. We tried several models, evaluated and compared them, aiming to create an effective recommendation system.

The first file includes: song ID, title, release (album), artist name, and release year.
